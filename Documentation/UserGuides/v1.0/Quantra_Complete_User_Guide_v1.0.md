## Core Trading Strategies

### Overview of Built-in Strategies

Quantra includes several professionally-developed trading strategies that can be used as-is or customized for your specific needs.

#### 1. Bollinger Bands Mean Reversion

**Strategy Concept:**
Uses Bollinger Bands to identify overbought and oversold conditions, executing trades when prices move outside the bands with the expectation of mean reversion.

**Key Parameters:**
- **Period**: Standard setting is 20 periods
- **Standard Deviations**: Typically 2.0 for upper and lower bands
- **Entry Threshold**: How far outside bands to trigger trades
- **Exit Strategy**: Mean reversion to moving average or opposite band

**Usage:**
1. Go to **Strategies > Bollinger Bands Strategy**
2. Configure parameters in the **Strategy Settings** panel
3. Backtest the strategy using historical data
4. Enable live trading with appropriate position sizing

**Best Practices:**
- Works best in ranging markets with established support/resistance
- Combine with volume analysis for confirmation
- Use shorter timeframes for active trading, longer for swing trading

#### 2. RSI Divergence Strategy

**Strategy Concept:**
Identifies divergences between price action and RSI momentum to predict potential trend reversals.

**Key Components:**

Uses MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) to identify trend changes and momentum shifts.

**Signal Types:**
- **Signal Line Crossovers**: MACD line crossing above/below signal line
- **Zero Line Crossovers**: MACD crossing above/below zero
- **Histogram Analysis**: Changes in MACD histogram for early signals

**Advanced Features:**

Exit Condition:
(RSI > 70) OR (Price > Upper Bollinger Band) OR (Stop Loss at -5%)

Position Size: 2% of portfolio
Maximum Positions: 5 concurrent trades
```

## Appendices

### Appendix A: Technical Indicator Formulas

#### Momentum Indicators

**RSI (Relative Strength Index):**
```
RS = Average Gain / Average Loss
RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))

Where:
- Average Gain = Sum of gains over n periods / n
- Average Loss = Sum of losses over n periods / n
- Typical period (n) = 14
```

**MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):**
```
MACD Line = EMA(12) - EMA(26)
Signal Line = EMA(9) of MACD Line
MACD Histogram = MACD Line - Signal Line

Where:
- EMA = Exponential Moving Average
- Numbers in parentheses are typical periods
```

**Stochastic Oscillator:**
```
%K = ((Close - Lowest Low) / (Highest High - Lowest Low)) × 100
%D = Simple Moving Average of %K over n periods

Where:
- Lowest Low = Lowest low over n periods (typically 14)
- Highest High = Highest high over n periods (typically 14)
- %D period typically 3
```

#### Trend Indicators

**Simple Moving Average (SMA):**
```
SMA = (P1 + P2 + ... + Pn) / n

Where:
- P = Price (typically closing price)
- n = Number of periods
```

**Exponential Moving Average (EMA):**
```
EMA = (Close × Multiplier) + (Previous EMA × (1 - Multiplier))
Multiplier = 2 / (n + 1)

Where:
- n = Number of periods
- Close = Current closing price
```

**Average Directional Index (ADX):**
```
+DI = (Smoothed +DM / ATR) × 100
-DI = (Smoothed -DM / ATR) × 100
DX = (|+DI - -DI| / (+DI + -DI)) × 100
ADX = Smoothed Average of DX

Where:
- +DM = Positive Directional Movement
- -DM = Negative Directional Movement
- ATR = Average True Range
```

#### Volatility Indicators

**Bollinger Bands:**
```
Middle Band = Simple Moving Average (typically 20 periods)
Upper Band = Middle Band + (Standard Deviation × 2)
Lower Band = Middle Band - (Standard Deviation × 2)

Standard Deviation = √(Σ(Close - SMA)² / n)
```

**Average True Range (ATR):**
```
True Range = Max of:
- Current High - Current Low
- |Current High - Previous Close|
- |Current Low - Previous Close|

ATR = Simple Moving Average of True Range over n periods (typically 14)
```

### Appendix B: Risk Management Formulas

#### Value at Risk (VaR) Calculations

**Historical VaR:**
```
Historical VaR = Portfolio Value × Percentile of Historical Returns

Where:
- Percentile typically 5% for 95% confidence level
- Historical returns sorted from worst to best
- VaR represents potential loss at confidence level
```

**Parametric VaR:**
```
Parametric VaR = Portfolio Value × Z-score × Portfolio Volatility × √Time Horizon

Where:
- Z-score = 1.645 for 95% confidence (1.96 for 97.5%)
- Portfolio Volatility = Standard deviation of portfolio returns
- Time Horizon = Typically 1 day (√1 = 1)
```

#### Position Sizing Formulas

**Kelly Criterion:**
```
f* = (bp - q) / b

Where:
- f* = Fraction of capital to wager
- b = Odds received on the wager (reward-to-risk ratio)
- p = Probability of winning
- q = Probability of losing (1 - p)
```

**Volatility-Based Position Sizing:**
```
Position Size = (Portfolio Risk Budget) / (Asset Volatility × Position Value)

Where:
- Portfolio Risk Budget = Maximum acceptable portfolio volatility
- Asset Volatility = Standard deviation of asset returns
- Position Value = Dollar value of position
```

#### Risk-Adjusted Performance Metrics

**Sharpe Ratio:**
```
Sharpe Ratio = (Portfolio Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Portfolio Standard Deviation

Where:
- Portfolio Return = Annualized portfolio return
- Risk-Free Rate = Annualized risk-free rate
- Portfolio Standard Deviation = Annualized portfolio volatility
```

**Sortino Ratio:**
```
Sortino Ratio = (Portfolio Return - Target Return) / Downside Deviation

Where:
- Target Return = Minimum acceptable return (often risk-free rate)
- Downside Deviation = Standard deviation of negative returns only
```

**Calmar Ratio:**
```
Calmar Ratio = Annualized Portfolio Return / Maximum Drawdown

Where:
- Maximum Drawdown = Largest peak-to-trough decline
- Ratio measures return per unit of worst-case loss
```
