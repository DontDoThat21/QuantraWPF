# Monte Carlo Simulations for Risk Assessment

## Overview

Monte Carlo simulation is a powerful technique for assessing the risk and robustness of trading strategies. Quantra's backtesting module includes Monte Carlo simulation capabilities that allow users to:

1. Generate thousands of alternative equity curves based on the original backtest results
2. Calculate probability distributions for key metrics like returns and drawdowns
3. Determine confidence intervals for strategy performance
4. Assess risk metrics like Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall
5. Visualize the range of potential outcomes for better decision-making

## How It Works

The Monte Carlo simulation in Quantra uses bootstrap resampling of the strategy's historical daily returns to generate multiple simulated equity curves. This approach:

1. Extracts daily returns from the original backtest equity curve
2. Randomly samples these returns (with replacement) to create alternative paths
3. Calculates key statistics across all simulated paths
4. Presents the results in an intuitive visualization

## Key Metrics

The Monte Carlo simulation provides the following risk assessment metrics:

### Return Distribution Percentiles

- **5% Worst Case**: The lower bound of the 90% confidence interval for returns
- **25% Lower Quartile**: The lower bound of the 50% confidence interval 
- **50% Median**: The median expected return
- **75% Upper Quartile**: The upper bound of the 50% confidence interval
- **95% Best Case**: The upper bound of the 90% confidence interval for returns

### Drawdown Distribution Percentiles

- **5% Best Case**: The lower bound of the 90% confidence interval for maximum drawdown
- **25% Lower Quartile**: The lower bound of the 50% confidence interval 
- **50% Median**: The median expected maximum drawdown
- **75% Upper Quartile**: The upper bound of the 50% confidence interval
- **95% Worst Case**: The upper bound of the 90% confidence interval for maximum drawdown

### Risk Metrics

- **Value at Risk (95%)**: The maximum expected loss at the 95% confidence level
- **Value at Risk (99%)**: The maximum expected loss at the 99% confidence level
- **Expected Shortfall (95%)**: The average of the worst 5% of return outcomes (also known as Conditional Value at Risk)
- **Probability of Profit**: The percentage of simulations that resulted in positive returns
- **Probability of Beating Backtest**: The percentage of simulations that exceeded the original backtest return

## How to Use

1. Run a backtest for your trading strategy
2. Go to the "Monte Carlo Simulation" tab in the Backtest Results
3. Select the desired number of simulations (more simulations provide more accurate results but take longer)
4. Click "Run Simulation"
5. Analyze the results to assess the robustness of your strategy

## Interpreting the Results

The Monte Carlo simulation results can help you understand:

- **Strategy Robustness**: Is the strategy's performance consistent across simulations?
- **Risk Profile**: What is the range of potential drawdowns you might experience?
- **Return Expectations**: What returns can you realistically expect from the strategy?
- **Confidence Intervals**: How confident can you be in the strategy's performance?

A robust strategy will show a tight distribution of returns and drawdowns, while a fragile strategy will show a wide distribution with significant downside risk.

## Technical Implementation

The Monte Carlo simulation module uses:

- Bootstrap resampling of daily returns
- Parallel processing for efficient simulation
- Statistical analysis for percentile calculations
- Interactive charts for visualizing results

## Best Practices

- Run at least 1,000 simulations for reliable results
- Compare different strategies using the same simulation count
- Consider the worst-case scenarios when evaluating strategy risk
- Don't rely solely on median outcomes when making decisions
- Use Monte Carlo simulations as part of a comprehensive risk management framework
